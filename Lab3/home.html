        <p>This is a normal paragraph. It uses a default san-serif font, and uses justified margins for aligning text,
            instead of the default text alignment.</p>
        <p>This is how a blockquote looks. Its text is indented, italicized and boldfaced:</p>
        <blockquote>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought in this continent, a new nation,
            conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal</blockquote>
        <p class="special">And this is a "special" paragraph. Its text is centered and underlined, and is not very easy
        on the eyes if there are multiple lines of text/ It really is not very appealing.</p>
    </body>
